# Carpool Project

## Overview

Many parents face the challenge of transporting their children to school, extracurricular activities, and other events, particularly when dealing with multiple kids and tight schedules. To help ease this burden, i have developed the **Carpool** app. This app is designed to help parents coordinate and manage carpool groups effectively, ensuring that every child has a safe and reliable way to get to their destination.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Carpool Group**: Parents can create a new carpool group based on their needs, whether it's for daily school commutes or occasional events.
2. **Schedule Rides**: Organize rides by assigning drivers to specific days and times, ensuring that every child is covered.
3. **Track and Notify**: Receive notifications about upcoming rides, and stay informed about any changes in the schedule.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter, allowing it to run on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time data synchronization.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrated for mapping and location services.
